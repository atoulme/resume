    This university picks up right after the SAT equivalent in France, and offers two years of common studies for all engineers.

    This is followed by three years of specialization in a discipline of engineering. Notably, Software development was not offered as my teachers were sure offshore development would be the main trend for the French software market.

    We instead studied further how to manage a complete informations system, from its requirements, its organization and its change management.

    I hold a master in Software Integration, Knowledge Management and Organizations Science.

    Armed with expert knowledge of UML, I joined a small startup in Paris where I started as an Eclipse developer for their UML edition product.

    As part of a 6 month computer science exchange program, I discovered America and American campus life.
    
    I worked closely with the teaching staff, taking on a lab assistant role for the C++ course.

    I learned Perl and explored beautiful Arcata. I loved it.
